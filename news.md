![](Images/MazzinghiAnna.jpg)

We are happy to announce the appointment of Dr Anna Mazzinghi as the next Zeno Karl Schindler/MINIARE Fellow. Anna was selected from an unprecedented pool of 84 extremely well-qualified applicants and will join our research team for twelve months starting in January 2018. She holds a PhD in Science for the conservation of Cultural Heritage from the University of Florence (Italy), where she defended a thesis on the development of scanning XRF instrumentation for cultural heritage applications in February 2016. For the past two years, Anna has been a post-doctoral Research Fellow in the Department of Physics and Astronomy of the University of Florence, working in the Laboratory of Nuclear Techniques for Environmental and Cultural Heritage (LABEC). She specialises in the analysis of painting materials by XRF spectroscopy and has worked on a wide range of artefacts, from lapis lazuli Egyptian amulets to Japanese katanas, and including a large number of paintings by Italian Renaissance Masters such as Botticelli, Raffaello and Leonardo da Vinci.

The [Zeno Karl Schindler Foundation](http://www.zenokarlschindler-foundation.ch/) supports, encourages and develops top research in the fields of engineering and environmental sciences as well as of all medieval disciplines. This is the third time that the Foundation is supporting the MINIARE project by sponsoring a joint Fellowship for early career researchers.

### 'Manuscripts in the Making: Art and Science'

8-10 December 2016  
Cambridge, UK

An international conference organised by The Fitzwilliam Museum, in association with the Departments of Chemistry and History of Art, University of Cambridge (UK) with support from the Samuel H. Kress Foundation and the Association for Manuscripts and Archives in Research Collections.

The conference will accompany the Fitzwilliam Museum's bicentenary exhibition [_'COLOUR: The Art and Science of Illuminated Manuscripts'_](http://www.fitzmuseum.cam.ac.uk/colour) (30 July - 30 December 2016).

This interdisciplinary conference will aim to break new ground in integrating recent advances in the art historical and technical analyses of illuminated manuscripts with research in social and intellectual history. While Western illuminated manuscripts from the 6th to the 16th centuries will form a major focus of discussion, the conference will also include papers on Byzantine, Islamic and Pre-Columbian material.

For more information including the list of speakers and conference programme, and to register for the conference, please visit: [http://www.fitzmuseum.cam.ac.uk/colour/conference](http://www.fitzmuseum.cam.ac.uk/colour/conference)

**Poster** contributions are welcome. We particularly welcome abstracts submitted by students and early-career researchers.

Authors are requested to submit abstracts no later than **30 June 2016**, using the template available on the conference webpage.

Please send your abstracts to [mima-conference@fitzmuseum.cam.ac.uk](mailto:mima-conference@fitzmuseum.cam.ac.uk). Authors will be informed of the acceptance of their contribution by **15 September 2016**.

### Exhibition _COLOUR: The Art and Science of Illuminated Manuscripts_  
The Fitzwilliam Museum, 30 July - 30 December 2016

![](Images/251_crop.jpg)

The [MINIARE](http://www.miniare.org) and [Cambridge Illuminations](http://www.fitzmuseum.cam.ac.uk/research/cambridgeilluminations) projects are the research platform of a major exhibition that celebrates the bicentenary of the Fitzwilliam Museum's foundation in 2016. The exhibition displays over 100 of the Fitzwilliam Museum's finest illuminated manuscripts representing the leading artistic centres of medieval and Renaissance Europe. Visitors are invited to examine in detail the artistic, intellectual and historic significance of the manuscripts. Digital displays allow them to leaf through multiple paintings within a manuscript; over-lay images of the same painting captured with different techniques; discover the pigments and techniques identified through cutting-edge, non-invasive scientific analyses; follow the trade routes that supplied artists' materials across Asia and Europe; and explore the relationships between the individuals involved in the manuscripts' production and early use.

The exhibition re-constructs the creative process, from the artists' original ideas through their choice of pigments and technical expertise to the finished works. It demonstrates how artists strove to break the barrier between images and viewers by engaging the senses, stimulating the mind, and stirring up emotions. The catalogue, written by an international team of experts and illustrated in full colour, is available for purchase online [at the Fitzwilliam Museum shop](http://www.fitzwilliammuseumshop.co.uk/pa_exhibition/colour-the-art-and-science-of-illuminated-manuscripts-july-to-december-2016/?filter_product_cat=58).

### 'The Colourful Page' - a short film about our research

![](Images/colourful.jpg)  

This short experimental documentary directed by Alice Corner explores the research of conservation scientist Paola Ricciardi, one of the members of the MINIARE research project. The film was produced as part of the Cambridge Shorts initiative, which allows University of Cambridge researchers at an early stage of their career to work with artists and film makers using innovative ways to visualise research processes and outputs.
