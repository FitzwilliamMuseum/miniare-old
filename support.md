Support Us

The systematic analysis of manuscript illumination is a complex and costly enterprise. In October 2011, MINIARE began as 
a two-year pilot project, focusing on the pigment analysis of Western manuscripts, with the support of a private donor, 
the Newton Trust, and Cambridge University. To achieve its long-term objectives and international impact MINIARE requires 
substantial resources. If you share our vision and are interested in supporting our activities, contact us at
